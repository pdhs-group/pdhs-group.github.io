Particles shape our world and everyday life: Macroscopic material and product qualities are determined by microscopic interactions.

Our goal is to answer pressing questions about agglomeration and breakage phenomena, when multiple materials come together. To achieve this, we believe in the synergy between theoretical modeling and hands-on experimentation.

Understanding the dynamics of these heterogeneous interfaces is crucial for optimizing manufacturing processes, improving material properties, and driving innovation in areas such as energy storage.
